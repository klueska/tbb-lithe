Threading Building Blocks (parlib port) - README
For questions or comments, please contact: 
Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.berkeley.edu>

This is the parlib port of TBB. It is based on the following tbb release:

June 28, 2012: IntelÂ® Threading Building Blocks 4.0 Update 5
tbb40_20120613oss stable release
http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/ver.php?fid=187

Currently this port supports schedulers for native pthreads, lithe, and
upthread. To compile for each, you need to set the environment variable as
shown below:

export TBB_THREADING_LIB=<pthread, lithe, upthread>

You don't have to export it if you include it on the make command line,
however, you will need to include it on every make command line if/when you run
'make examples', so it's easier to just export it into your environment.

If you have installed lithe, upthread, or parlib in non-standard locations, you
will also need to set the following environment variables before compiling this
library. 

PARLIB_PREFIX=<parlib_install_dir>
LITHE_PREFIX=<lithe_install_dir>
UPTHREAD_PREFIX=<upthread_install_dir>

After following these steps, you should be able to run 'make' to compile tbb,
and 'make examples' to run all of the TBB examples.
For some reason, the first time running 'make examples' will fail, and you will
need to run it a second time.  I think it has something to do with parallel
make targets not having their dependencies setup properly, but I haven't looked
into this too deeply.

Running 'make test' is not currently supported.
