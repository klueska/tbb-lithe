Threading Building Blocks (lithe port) - README
For questions or comments, please contact: 
Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.berkeley.edu>

This is the lithe port of TBB. It is based on the following tbb release:

June 28, 2012: IntelÂ® Threading Building Blocks 4.0 Update 5
tbb40_20120613oss stable release
http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/ver.php?fid=187

If you have installed lithe and parlib in non-standard locations, you need to
set the following variables before compiling this library. 

PARLIB_PREFIX=<parlib_install_dir>
LITHE_PREFIX=<lithe_install_dir>

After doing this, you should be able to just run 'make' to compile tbb, and
'make examples' to run all of the TBB examples.  Currently some of these
examples fail -- we are working hard to get this fixed.

You can also run 'make test' to run the regression tests, but again, some of
these fail currently, and we are in the process of resolving this.
