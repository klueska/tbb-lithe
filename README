Threading Building Blocks (lithe port) - README
For questions or comments, please contact: Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.berkeley.edu>

This is the lithe port of TBB.  If you have installed lithe and parlib in
non-standard locations, you need to set the following variables before
compiling this library. 

PARLIB_PREFIX=<parlib_install_dir>
LITHE_PREFIX=<lithe_install_dir>

After doing this, you should be able to just run 'make' to compile tbb, and
'make examples' to run all of the TBB tests.  Some of these tests fail, but
that is normal -- they even fail when running them for TBB without lithe
support.

########## Below are the directions from the original TBB README ##############
See index.html for directions and documentation.

If source is present (./Makefile and src/ directories),
type 'gmake' in this directory to build and test.

See examples/index.html for runnable examples and directions.

See http://threadingbuildingblocks.org for full documentation
and software information.
